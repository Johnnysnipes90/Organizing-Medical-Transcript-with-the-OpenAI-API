By leveraging AI, unstructured natural language can be processed into organized data. This can reduce administrative tasks for healthcare professionals, freeing more time for direct patient care. In this project, I help the medical team automate the extraction and interpretation of vital information from their transcripts using the OpenAI API.

# Medical Transcription → ICD-10 Structuring Pipeline

Healthcare professionals spend hours daily extracting structured data from messy, natural-language medical transcripts.  
This project automates that workflow using the **OpenAI API**, producing structured key fields:

- Patient **age**
- Recommended **treatment** or procedure
- **Medical specialty**
- Automatically matched **ICD-10 code**

All wrapped in a clean, modular, production-ready pipeline suitable for machine learning engineers, data engineers, and AI research roles.
